#Getting started

## Local usage

### Clone the repository.
```
> git clone ...
```

### Install the package
```
> npm install -d
```

### Build the site
```
> grunt
```

Once the site is generated, a browser will be opened, displaying the result.

### Live reloads
When running the site locally, the grunt script will be watcing the `/src/` folder for changes.
If any change is detected, this will trigger a regenreation of the content and your browser will be live reloaded.
